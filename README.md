# rehab-scales-validation

Our network of rehabilitation centers across France uses 8 main questionnaires/scales: the WEMWBS, the STORI, the SQoL, the SERS, the MARS, and the EAS. These scales are all self-questionaire except the EAS which is a hetero-evaluation of a patient's autonomy.  
To the best of our knowledge, these scales have mostly been validated in healthy controls and in patients with schizophrenia. Only the SQoL has been validated in patients with bipolar disorders. In addition, these scales have not been validated in rehabilitation settings.  

The goal of this study is to validate these scales in six psychiatric populations treated in rehabilitation settings: patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, autism spectrum disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, personality disorders.  

We'll follow the six steps guidelines from Dima, 2018: Scale validation in applied health research: tutorial for a 6-step R-based psychometrics protocol, published in Health Psychology and Behavioral Medicine (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642850.2018.1472602). We'll also use Dima's scripts.
